FreePats synthesizer percussion
-------------------------------

Version 2022-07-18

These sounds had been created by Roberto <roberto@zenvoid.org> with Yoshimi
and Geonkick free software synthesizers, and edited with Audacity. They are an
aproximation to drum kit sounds commonly used on vintage electronic music made
with analog synthesizers.

This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is available on the
FreePats project web pages: http://freepats.zenvoid.org/
